Messages hold different types of arguments which do not have to be in a specific order. 
The structure of any message should be: key1=string1:key2=string2:key3=string3 and so on.
That also means that neither equals nor colon are allowed in the keys or mapped strings.

All messages should contain the key "action", while all other keys can be named freely.
All keys and mapped strings have to be lower case only! (Case sensitive checking!!)

This is a list of all strings mapped to by "action" that are currently in use:
